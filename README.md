py-kodi-remote-controller
=========================

Kodi remote controller module written in Python

## Summary

Initially developped as a simple command line client, PyKodi is now a standalone module that could be used to develop Kodi clients in Python. PyKodi allows you to do many operations on your audio library, like searching for songs and albums, creating playlist, starting or stopping the player (only audio controls are provided).

In some specific context, it would be great to control Kodi from a terminal, wouldn't it? Let's say that you are coding something and want to play some background music. The ``cmd`` client is here for that. This client provides a command line interface to the PyKodi module.

The integration with [echonest][echonest] has been introduced with the version 0.2. Echonest is the recommendation engine that powers Spotify. This feature will allow you to create instantly smart playlists, tailored to your tastes. Read [this blog post][variogr.am] to learn more about echonest and how it works.

## Installation and setup

### Enable JSON-RPC in Kodi

Make sure to activate the communication interface in Kodi. Have a look at the official [documentation][http] to activate the HTTP transport. As a result, you should now know the IP, port, user and password of the Kodi web interface. Those information will have to be entered in the client.

The TCP transport is no longer supported, but could be introduced again later on.

### PyKodi

Simple and straightforward, just clone this repository on your workstation. The code is based on standard modules or best of class external modules (mainly ``requests`` for the API calls).

### Echonest

If you want to release the full potential of PyKodi, you need to [create an account][echonest-register] on the echonest developper web site and request an API key. You also need to upgrade the rate limit to 120 calls by minute (this rate is used by the sync process). The echonest integration relies heavily on clean MusicBrainz metadata. The matching with the echonest database is based on the MusicBrainz ID. Without a proper tagging, you will not be able to use this feature.

This service is absolutly free of charge.

## Quick start

This part describes how to use the ``cmd`` client. If you are interested in the module only, read the code of the ``cmd`` client which is basically a wrapper of the module. ``cmd`` is a line-oriented command interpreter. Considering reading a [tutorial][cmd-tutorial] or the [Python docs][cmd-docs] to learn more on how to use it. It notably supports online help and auto-completion.

### General usage

In the ``cmd`` client, albums and songs are identify with their internal ID, respectively ``albumid`` and ``songid``. To play an album, you have to request to play the album's ID. The application provides seach functions to identify easily the items that you want to play. The IDs is also displayed in all outputs in brackets.

### First start

From the repository folder, call the client. You will see the default ``cmd`` prompt, with a banner requesting to enter the Kodi parameters.

````
$ python pykodi_cmd.py
(cmd) 
````

Execute the command ``params_inputs`` and type in the parameters as requested. The prompt will change to the Kodi system name, meaning that the client has been able to fetch some information. You can skip the echonest API for this quick start.

````
(xxx) params_inputs
````

The next step is to sync the audio library locally. It is not absolutly mandatory, but it will be far more convenient. For example, you will be able to search for a string in your library instantly, since all your library will be store in memory. This has to be done for the songs and/or the albums. The sync process can take several minutes if your library is large.

````
(xxx) albums_sync
(xxx) songs_sync
````

The library is stored on local files, so the next time that you start the client, there is no need to sync again.

### Let's play something

Search for the string ``yyy`` in the albums library with the following command line:

````
(xxx) albums_search yyy
````

The search is done in the albums titles and artists. The list of hits is displayed with the ``albumid`` in bracket. This ID has to be used to play something. Let's say that you want to play the album ``999``:

````
(xxx) play_albums 999
````

The album ``999`` should now rock the room!

### More features

The ``cmd`` module supports online help and autocompletion. You can find documentation from the ``cmd`` application by itself. The functions are organized by prefix. So just enter the prefix and click on ``tab`` to have a list of available functions:

+ ``params_`` Kodi parameters management and echonest API
+ ``albums_`` albums library management and search
+ ``genres_`` albums genres library management and search 
+ ``songs_`` songs library management and search
+ ``play_`` player start, stop, information and echonest feedback
+ ``playlist_`` playlist management

You can update the local library ``rating`` and ``playcounts`` by syncing again the albums and songs library with ``albms_sync`` and ``songs_sync``.

### Smart playlist with echonest

Update your tasteprofile with ``echonest_sync``. Create a catalog to scope the recommendation.

Update regularly.

This will be used by echonest to identify your listening preferences.

make favorite, skip and ban.

### Library updates

The built-in syncing process only support updates on the ``rating`` and ``playcounts``. Also, if new albums are detected, a full sync will be triggered.

After a migration, you may scan your music folder from scratch. As a consequence, the **internal Kodi items ID may change** and PyKodi will not detect it. 

## Contributions

An issue in the bug tracker is already great.

### Hand-on

Contributions are welcome and easy.

The code is far from stable, if you face any trouble, post an issue in the GitHub tracking tool. New features can be requested in the bug tracker either. If you want to provide new features by yourself, submit a pull request.

The program can be started in a highly verbose mode with the ``-vv`` argument. All API commands and returns will then be displayed. Use the methods ``call_api`` and ``display_result`` for wrapping new command.
